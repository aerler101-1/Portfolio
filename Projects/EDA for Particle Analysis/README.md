Subatomic Particle Identification EDA
The purpose of this project is being an intial EDA on a set of particle data. Our goal is to see if certain features can be used to predict particles that hit the detecor. 
This information is for exploratory purposes only and to see what features would be best chosen for model creation further down the line.
