# Predictive Modeling for Spaceship Titanic

## Introduction
This project develops a predictive model to ascertain the "transported" status of passengers on the Spaceship Titanic, a unique dataset combining elements of historical data and science fiction. The model aims to analyze passenger data to identify key factors influencing their transportation outcome.

## Business Problem
The primary objective is to identify patterns and characteristics that correlate with the likelihood of passengers being transported. This understanding can provide valuable insights into passenger demographics, behavior, and other factors.

## Data Explanation
The dataset includes variables such as passenger class, age, fare, cabin, and home planet. Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution of these variables, identify missing values, and detect outliers. Techniques like imputation were used for handling missing data, and categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding.

## Methods
Gradient Boosting was selected for its robustness in handling mixed data types and its superior performance in classification tasks. The model underwent hyperparameter tuning for optimization, utilizing techniques like grid search to identify the best parameters.

## Analysis
The project involved:
- Detailed EDA to understand data trends and relationships.
- Building a baseline Gradient Boosting model.
- Iterative improvements through hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion
The Gradient Boosting model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, with notable accuracy in determining the transported status of passengers. The insights derived could be potentially valuable in similar predictive scenarios.

## Limitations and Challenges
- Gradient Boosting's complexity can hinder interpretability.
- Managing large datasets post one-hot encoding was challenging.
- Computational limitations during model training and tuning.

## Future Directions
- Experimenting with ensemble methods to combine different models.
- Exploring feature engineering to unearth more subtle patterns.
- Addressing ethical aspects and ensuring transparency in methodology.
